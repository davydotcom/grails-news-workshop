# Step 2 Instructions

We need to implement a controller and view to list all submitted posts as well as to allow the submission of posts

* The Root URL should list posts submitted by date descending (30 per page)
* The web app should container a /submit url for submitting posts

To get started we must first create a `PostController`:

```
grails create-controller Post
```


## Resources

For this part of the tutorial we will be primarily dealing with Controller creation as well as `UrlMappings`
